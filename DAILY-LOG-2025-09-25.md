# Daily Progress Log – 2025-09-25

## Summary
Refinements to the sacred navigation UI (SacredModulesStrip) and Radio pill styling. Implemented and iterated on a dark red LIVE radio emphasis, then toned it down per feedback to a subtle glass pill with a minimal pulsing indicator.

## Key Changes
- Added new `SacredModulesStrip` component (glassy module pills with underline hover animation, RTL/LTR ordering logic).
- Introduced emphasized Radio pill (initial deep dark red gradient + full-pulse effect).
- Added custom pulse keyframes: `sacred-pulse-red` in `globals.css`.
- Adjusted Radio pill after feedback: removed strong red saturation, replaced with subtle translucent tinted background + small pulsing dot + lighter red text treatment.
- Ensured Arabic layout: Radio first; English layout: Radio last.
- Maintained consistent shadow strategy (moderate internal shadows, no heavy outer halo).

## Files Touched
- `gaish-elmafdein-nextjs/src/components/ui/SacredModulesStrip.tsx`
- `gaish-elmafdein-nextjs/app/globals.css` (new animation)
- Other UI files previously adjusted today (Nav / Hero) still staged.

## Design Decisions
- Pulse localized to a dot to avoid visual overload.
- Retained underline interaction for consistency across all pills.
- Color harmony: Rest of pills use amber/orange hover; Radio uses restrained crimson accent.

## Next Suggestions
- Optional: Double-beat pulse variant for LIVE.
- Optional: Accessibility audit (prefers-reduced-motion handling for pulse animations).
- Optional: Snapshot tests for RTL ordering.
